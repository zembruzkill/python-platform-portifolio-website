Welcome to the repository of our Python programming courses portal! This fictitious project was developed using React.js with Next.js to provide a fast and efficient development experience. Our portal aims to fictitiously provide a platform for delivering high-quality Python programming courses to a wide range of users, from beginners to experienced programmers seeking improvement.

## Features

-   **Course Catalog:** We offer a wide variety of Python programming courses, covering basic concepts to advanced topics such as data science, web development, automation, and more.

-   **Learning Materials:** Each course includes learning materials such as videos, tutorials, practical exercises, and quizzes to help students consolidate their knowledge.

-   **Authentication System:** We have implemented a secure authentication system so that fictitious users can enroll in courses, track their progress, and access exclusive materials for enrolled students.

## Technologies Used

-   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing the creation of reusable and efficient components.

-   **Next.js:** A React framework that enables server-side rendering, simple routing, and other useful features for the development of modern web applications.

-   **Prisma:** An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for Node.js and TypeScript that facilitates access to the database and data manipulation.

-   **MySQL (PlanetScale):** We use the MySQL database hosted on PlanetScale to store the data for our courses portal.
